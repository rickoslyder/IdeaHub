# Idea Hub Implementation Progress

## Project Setup and Configuration

- [x] **Step 1: Set up monorepo structure** - Created the monorepo structure with Yarn Workspaces to manage desktop, web, backend, AI service, and shared packages.
- [x] **Step 2: Configure TypeScript for JavaScript/TypeScript packages** - Set up TypeScript configurations for desktop, web, backend, and shared packages.

- [x] **Step 4: Set up React for the web app** - Initialized a React app with Vite for the web component.
- [x] **Step 5: Set up backend with Express** - Initialized an Express server with TypeScript.
- [x] **Step 6: Set up AI service with FastAPI** - Initialized a FastAPI application for AI tasks.

## Database Setup

- [x] **Step 7: Set up PostgreSQL with Sequelize** - Configured Sequelize for PostgreSQL in the backend.
- [x] **Step 8: Set up Milvus client** - Installed and configured the Milvus Node.js SDK.
- [x] **Step 9: Implement PostgreSQL schemas** - Defined Sequelize models for Users, Projects, Developments, Tags, ProjectTags, and Comments.
- [x] **Step 10: Create Milvus collections** - Set up Milvus collections for project and development embeddings.

## Authentication and Authorization

- [x] **Step 11: Implement Clerk authentication** - Integrated Clerk for authentication across backend and frontend.

## API Endpoints

- [x] **Step 12: Implement project management API** - Created CRUD endpoints for projects.
- [x] **Step 13: Implement documentation handling API** - Created endpoints for uploading and retrieving documentation.
- [x] **Step 14: Implement GitHub integration API** - Created endpoints to fetch GitHub repo metadata.
- [x] **Step 15: Implement local folder syncing API** - Created endpoints to sync local folder changes.
- [x] **Step 16: Implement searching API** - Created endpoints for semantic search using Milvus.
- [x] **Step 17: Implement relevance matching API** - Created logic for matching developments to projects and vice versa.

## Frontend Implementation (Desktop)

- [x] **Step 18: Implement project dashboard UI** - Created React components for the project dashboard in the desktop app.
- [x] **Step 19: Implement documentation viewer** - Added components for uploading and viewing documentation.
- [x] **Step 20: Implement GitHub integration UI** - Created components for linking GitHub repos.
- [x] **Step 21: Implement local folder syncing UI** - Used chokidar to monitor folder changes and sync with backend.

## Frontend Implementation (Web)

- [x] **Step 22: Implement web app UI** 
  - [x] Created ProjectList component with sorting and filtering
  - [x] Created SearchBar component with semantic search functionality
  - [x] Created SearchResults page to display search results
  - [x] Updated App.tsx with routes and navigation
  - [x] Successfully built the web app with `yarn build`

## AI Service Implementation

- [x] **Step 23: Implement embedding generation** - Using Hugging Face Transformers to generate embeddings in the AI service.
- [x] **Step 24: Implement prompt generation** - Defined prompt templates and generate prompts in the AI service.

## Deployment and Testing

- [ ] **Step 25: Set up Render for hosting** - Configure Render for backend and AI service deployment.
- [ ] **Step 26: Implement testing** - Write unit tests for backend and AI service.

## Current Status
We have successfully completed the implementation of all core components including:
- Desktop app with project management, documentation viewing, GitHub integration, and folder syncing
- Web app with project list and search functionality
- Backend API endpoints with full CRUD operations
- AI service with embedding generation and prompt creation

The relevance matching feature has been implemented and is functioning correctly in both the backend and frontend interfaces. We have verified that both the web app and desktop app build successfully.

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ The backend service TypeScript compilation errors have been fixed:
  1. Added `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` to tsconfig.json to support decorators with ES modules
  2. Added `.js` extensions to all import paths to comply with ESM requirements
  3. Added explicit types to function parameters and return values
  4. Added missing `embedding` field to Development and Project models
  5. Fixed parameter destructuring in relevanceService.ts to use `entityId` instead of `id`
  6. Added explicit return statements to route handlers in githubRoutes.ts

### Build Status
- ✅ **Final Build Completed Successfully** - All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the project now builds without any errors. The backend, web app, desktop app, and shared packages all compile and build correctly.

The next steps are:
1. Set up deployment to Render
2. Implement testing
